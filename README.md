Playwright is a framework for Web Testing and Automation. It allows testing Chromium, Firefox and WebKit with a single API. Playwright is built to enable cross-browser web automation that is ever-green, capable, reliable and fast.

By default, Playwright runs the browsers in headless mode. To see the browser UI, pass the setHeadless(false) flag while launching the browser. You can also use slowMo to slow down execution. 
 playwright.firefox().launch(new BrowserType.LaunchOptions().setHeadless(false).setSlowMo(50));
